This is the code for the javascript game Student problems

We have a game with a horizontal runner.  The runner is a student who realizes she has an assignment due in one minute. She has to run towards her computer. On her way the runner could be hit by power ups and power downs, thrown at her horizontally. Power ups would include coffee, energy drinks and things like that. Power downs would include netflix, youtube and so forth. Sugar (sweets) makes you fast and indestructible at first but then slows you down. If you fall into the bed the game is over. Every power up make you speed up or increases the time you have, each power down you collect decreases your time or slows you down. If you do not reach the end before your time is up you lose the game.
